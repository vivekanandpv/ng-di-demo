Steps:
1. Remove providedIn: root from service so that it is not provided in the root injector
2. Now, providedIn removed, the injection fails in components
3. We now provide this service manually at the module level. In app.module.ts, providers array has DemoService
4. Service still appears to be singleton, but only to the extent of the module
